Project Summary: YouTube Backend System with Spring Boot and FastAPI!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
This project integrates Spring Boot with FastAPI to provide key features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Video Recommendations
Content Moderation
Ad Targeting


Spring Boot serves as a gateway, receiving user requests and forwarding them to FastAPI for processing.
FastAPI handles the heavy lifting like machine learning for recommendations, content moderation, and ad targeting.


Workflow:
User Request to Spring Boot: The user initiates a request (e.g., recommendations, content moderation, or ad targeting).
Spring Boot Forwards to FastAPI: Spring Boot uses RestTemplate to forward the request to FastAPI's endpoints.
FastAPI Processes Request: FastAPI processes the request and returns a result (e.g., recommendations, moderation status, or targeted ads).


Response to User: Spring Boot receives the response and sends it back to the user.
How FastAPI and Spring Boot Connect:

FastAPI handles backend processing (e.g., ML models for video recommendations).
Spring Boot manages API requests, validates input, and forwards requests to FastAPI.
Both services are independent, enabling scalability and flexibility.

Benefits:

Separation of Concerns: Spring Boot manages user-facing APIs, FastAPI handles backend logic.
Scalability: Each component scales independently.

Efficiency: FastAPI ensures fast processing of machine learning and backend tasks.
Postman Testing:

1. Video Recommendations:
-------------------------
POST /recommendations/
Input:
json

{
  "user_id": 123,
  "video_id": 456,
  "watch_time": 120.5
}

Expected Output:
json

{
  "recommended_videos": [789, 101, 102]
}

2. Content Moderation:
----------------------

POST /moderation/
Input:
json

{
  "video_id": 456,
  "video_content": "This video contains some offensive language."
}
Expected Output:
json

{
  "moderation_status": "Rejected"
}

3. Ad Targeting:
----------------
GET /ad-targeting?user_id=123&video_id=456
Input: user_id=123, video_id=456
Expected Output:
json

{
  "targeted_ads": ["Ad1", "Ad2", "Ad3"]
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
This system efficiently integrates Spring Boot for API management and FastAPI for backend processing, making it scalable and efficient. The use of Postman for testing ensures that the features work seamlessly under different scenarios, ready for real-world deployment.
